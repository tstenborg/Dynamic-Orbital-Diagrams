# Dynamic-Orbital-Diagrams

Dynamic planetary orbital diagrams in Word via VBA.

Dynamic Planetary Orbital Diagrams.docm    Macro-enabled Word document.

Dynamic planetary orbital diagrams were developed for Microsoft Word. Rendering routines were built with Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), the scripting language built into Microsoft's Office suite. Macro-enabled content must be active in Word to render dynamic diagrams. The macros are computationally intensive, so the document may be slower than typical Word documents to open.
